Morning
""
"Morning precedes afternoon, evening, and night in the sequence of a day. Originally, the term referred to sunrise.[2]"
"The Modern English words ""morning"" and ""tomorrow"" began in Middle English as morwening, developing into morwen, then morwe, and eventually morrow. English, unlike some other languages, has separate terms for ""morning"" and ""tomorrow"", despite their common root. Other languages, like Dutch, Scots and German, may use a single word – morgen – to signify both ""morning"" and ""tomorrow"".[3][4]"
